# Route 66: Story Map


## Project Outline

For the project, I create a story map application for a traveling Route 66 dataset
of my choosing. A story map tells a story through several slides, each slide
combining text and data. The user is able to move forward and backwards through
the slides by clicking on next and previous buttons.
